		<p>I Created a subdirectory of my  &quotpublic_html&quot directory and called it  &quotcs15020&quot .
I created an index.html, cv.htm, about.html, style.css and myjs.js. I downloaded the background image and banner image from the free site https://pixabay.com. I modified the banner using Photoshop. I deleted the background in the banner to make it transparent and I saved it as .png. Later I put it as a main background. I created a horizontal navigation because I think my site looks with it much better than with a  vertical navigation. :) In the menu area, I have placed links to the parts of my previous assignments (my Wordpress blog and eCommerce page). During this task I had a problem with JavaScript.
 I did not know how to make JS run from a separate file. I found the solution at https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_script_src.asp
But I put &quotlastModified&quot script inside the HTML code because I want show you I understand this. CSS is very interesting. 
I can make many combinations. I added in the footer the two validators (CSS and HTML) required and a JavaScript to display the latest review. 

The website I used to learn if I did not understand something was mainly   <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">'w3schools'</a> site.
The problem that I did not solve was the adaptation of the website to mobile devices. This was not required
 in the task, but we live in a world where we use mobile devices on a daily basis.he problem that I did not solve was
